# Swift and SwiftUI Development Guidelines

This document outlines best practices and guidelines for Swift and SwiftUI development.

## Code Structure

- Use Swift's latest features and protocol-oriented programming
- Prefer value types (structs) over reference types (classes) when possible
- Implement MVVM architecture with SwiftUI
- Organize code structure using:
  - Features/ - Feature-specific components
  - Core/ - Core functionality and business logic
  - UI/ - Reusable UI components
  - Resources/ - Assets and resources
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for consistent user experience

## Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for types
- Use verbs for method names (e.g., `fetchData()`)
- For boolean variables, use prefixes like `is`, `has`, or `should` (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasCompletedSetup`)
- Use clear, descriptive names following Apple's style guidelines
- Be consistent in naming patterns across your codebase

## Swift Best Practices

- Leverage Swift's strong type system and use proper optional handling
- Use modern Swift concurrency with `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- Use the `Result` type for error handling
- Utilize property wrappers like `@Published` and `@StateObject` for state management
- Prefer `let` over `var` for immutability when possible
- Use protocol extensions for sharing code across types
- Apply Swift's functional programming concepts where appropriate

## UI Development

- Prioritize SwiftUI for UI development, using UIKit only when necessary
- Use SF Symbols for consistent iconography
- Support dark mode and dynamic type for accessibility
- Use SafeArea and GeometryReader for proper layout management
- Ensure UI works properly across all supported screen sizes and orientations
- Implement proper keyboard handling and avoidance

## Performance Optimization

- Profile your application with Instruments to identify bottlenecks
- Implement lazy loading for views and images
- Optimize network requests and caching strategies
- Implement proper background task handling
- Manage state efficiently to avoid unnecessary UI updates
- Follow proper memory management practices

## Data and State Management

- Use CoreData for complex data models and persistence
- Store user preferences in UserDefaults
- Utilize Combine framework for reactive programming
- Implement a clean data flow architecture
- Apply proper dependency injection techniques
- Handle state restoration appropriately

## Security Best Practices

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use Keychain Services API for secure storage
- Implement certificate pinning for secure network communications
- Integrate biometric authentication when appropriate
- Configure App Transport Security properly
- Validate all user inputs and external data

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests using XCTest framework
- Implement UI tests with XCUITest
- Test common user flows and edge cases
- Conduct performance testing for critical paths
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Ensure accessibility compliance through testing

## Essential App Features

- Support for deep linking and universal links
- Push notification integration
- Background processing capabilities
- Full localization and internationalization
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Implement analytics and logging for monitoring

## Development Process

- Leverage SwiftUI previews for rapid UI development
- Follow a consistent Git branching strategy
- Implement code review processes
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Write clear documentation for your code
- Maintain high unit test coverage

## App Store Guidelines Compliance

- Include proper privacy descriptions
- Configure app capabilities appropriately
- Follow guidelines for in-app purchases
- Adhere to App Store review guidelines
- Implement app thinning for optimized downloads
- Ensure proper code signing and provisioning

Always refer to Apple's official documentation for detailed implementation guidance on specific features and APIs.
